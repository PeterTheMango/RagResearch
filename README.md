# RagResearch

A personal research project exploring RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) systems and membership inference attacks.

## Project Structure

- **`notes/`** - Daily research notes documenting findings and observations during testing
  - Files follow the naming convention: `DD_MM_YY.md`
- **`articles/`** - Research papers and articles used to inform testing methodologies

- **`RagTesting.ipynb`** - Implementation experiments for building a RAG system

- **`MIARagTesting.ipynb`** - Recreation and testing of membership inference attack (MIA) techniques from research literature

## Overview

This repository contains my exploration of RAG systems, including implementation attempts and security analysis through membership inference attacks.
